    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <br>I am happy to take at this subject about covid-19, like we know that this disease is dangerous which consider a timed bomb that may by destroy the world if wouldn't take care, We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history
    of the United Nations — one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people’s lives. But this is much more than a health crisis. It is a human, economic and social crisis. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has been characterized
    as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is attacking societies at their core. This various have a bad effect on people especially children and old people, so we should keep things clean, wash hands, wear the mask and always keep a distance
    between each other, as this various spread quickly, then we will take about the turn of the country should provides all needs and try to encourage the scientists to fid a solution to this problem, and help to build many hospitals, force people to
    stay at home , wearing the mask, make the process of education in house. By engorge computer engineering to make many websites with many ideas which help to awareness people for example encourage online marketing, make them know the medicines quickly,
    make student study in home. The economy and COVID-19: that may have a big effect in the economy of the country, but finally we should aware people how to adapt with thus disease to save their life.<br/>

    <br><b>Literature Review</b><br/>
    <p>At this research we will take about COVD-19 and the role of computer engineering to deal with this disease.</p>

    <br>1) what is COVD-19<br/>
    <br>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an outbreak of respiratory
    illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. [1] It was initially reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. [2, 3] On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19
    a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 influenza a pandemic in 2009. [4] Illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 was termed COVID-19 by the WHO, the acronym derived from "coronavirus disease 2019. " The name was chosen to avoid stigmatizing
    the virus's origins in terms of populations, geography, or animal associations The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice
    respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow) i
    <br/>

    <br>2) the effect of COVD-19 on people:<br/>
    <br>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
    chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others
    from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. ii<br/>

    <br>3) Who is most at risk?<br/>
    <br> Those most at risk are “people 65 years and older, people who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility, people with chronic lung, heart, kidney and liver disease,” said Dr. Gary Weinstein, pulmonologist/critical care medicine specialist
    at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas (Texas Health Dallas). Additionally, he said others who could be at risk are those with compromised immune systems and people with morbid obesity or diabetes. Older persons are particularly susceptible
    to the risk of infection from COVID-19, especially those with chronic health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Older persons are not just struggling with greater health risks but are also likely to be less capable
    of supporting themselves in isolation. Although social distancing is necessary to reduce the spread of the disease, if not implemented correctly, such(pic(1)) measurescan also lead to increased social isolation of older persons at a time when they
    may be at most need of support. iii
