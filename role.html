    <br>1) How people can protect themselves from COVD-19:<br/>
    <br>: Keep things clean Preventative measures are your first line of defense, The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to practice good hygiene and to make these CDC recommendations part of your routine: Wash your hands often with soap and
    water for at least 20 seconds, If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. especially after going to the bathroom, before
    eating,(pic(1)) and after blowing your nose, wear a cloth face mask wear a cloth face mask restrict your travel, Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, Avoid close contact with people who are sick, Stay home when you are sick<br/>

    <br>2) the economic in world and COVID-19:<br/>
    <br>Like we know that COVID-19 effect on the industry, as all have to stay at home to less the gatherings to avoid the spread of the disease, as every country had to stop the transport between each other for example stopping air traffic and immobilization
    ships which lead to stop import and export process, also had to stop education but we can use online education . Without urgent socio-economic responses, global suffering will escalate, jeopardizing lives and livelihoods for years to come. Immediate
    development responses in this crisis must be undertaken with an eye to the future. Development trajectories in the long-term will be affected by the choices countries make now and the support they receive, for example, homeless people, because they
    may be unable to safely shelter in place, are highly exposed to the danger of the virus. people without access to running water, refugees, migrants, or displaced persons also stand to suffer disproportionately both from the pandemic and its aftermath
    â€“ whether due to limited movement, fewer employment opportunities, increased xenophobia etc.iv<br/>

    <br>3) computer engineering and COVID-19:<br/>
    <br>we all know that COVID-19 are going to destroy our world if we didn't take care, and cooperate with each other two find a solution to this problem, as scientists can make websites to advise people how to core themselves, making education programs
    to learn the students, the country should take its turn to provide all needs to the people especially poor people.
